### A list of CSS Libraries that I want to try out for my own use and for my Youtube channel
#### By Indigo Tech Tutorials

### Need To Try

#### Css Zero
A simple css library that doesn't require any css frameworks and uses stimulusjs
[Css Zero](https://github.com/lazaronixon/css-zero)

### Already Tried

#### PhlexUI/RubyUI
I didn't like this because it requires you to use Phlex which seems difficult to add into Rails app and I don't like the syntax

#### Rails Designer
I tried it and it seemed nice but the license was crazy its limited to only one project so I'm scared if I use 2 projects he will get mad

#### Tailwind UI
Good components but basic and over used. They have free options which is nice because you can test out some before deciding to purchase or not

#### Bootstrap components
Great component library perfect for beginnners and people who don't want to worry about learning advanced frontend skills. Very trusted and reputable
